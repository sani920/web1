 <p>On Tuesday evening, the House adopted a resolution almost entirely along party lines calling on Vice President Mike Pence to use the 25th Amendment to strip Mr. Trump of his powers. Ahead of the vote, Mr. Pence rejected the nonbinding resolution in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, writing that invoking the 25th Amendment would “set a terrible precedent.”

Just one Republican, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voted in favor of Tuesday’s resolution.
